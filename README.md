The Intro to ML Class Projects


Final_Submission.py is a class project where we are given an unknown dataset with a large number of attributes and a binary class value. 
No description of the dataset or attributes were given, only the range of each attributes. After a lot of trial and errors, I've determined
that lightbgm gives the best performance.
