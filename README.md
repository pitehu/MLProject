# MLProject
The Intro to ML Class Projects


Final_Submission.py is a class project where we are given an unknown dataset with a large number of attributes and a binary class value. 
No description of the dataset or attributes were given, only the range of each attributes. After a lot of trial and errors, I've determined
that lightbgm gives the best performance. 


In decisiontree.py, I implement the ID3 algorithem from scractch. For simplicity, it is assumed that all attributes are binary. 

In naivebayes.py, I implement a Naive Bayes classifier.

In MDP.py, I implement the value iteration algorithm for finding the optimal policy for
each state of an MDP using Bellmanâ€™s equation. 

In neuralnets.py, I implement a sigmoid unit for binary classification tasks with gradient descent all from scratch. My model is able to process any binary classification task with any number of binary-valued attributes.
